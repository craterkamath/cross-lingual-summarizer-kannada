Welcome to clstk's documentation!
======================================

``clstk`` is a free and open source tool-kit for cross-lingual summarization (CLS).
The tool-kit is intended for the use of both, developers and researchers working on cross-lingual summarization.
End-users wanting to use cross-lingual summarization in real-world applications can also benefit from the tool-kit.

The tool-kit currently contains implementation of three CLS methods along with bootstrap code and other modules required for CLS.
We encourage developers to contribute more methods in the tool-kit.
